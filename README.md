# Studentdetailsapp

GUI app that stores students details in a json file and performs data analysis to return the mean score,
max score, minimum score, best scoring student(s), failed student(s) and students who scored above 69.
A user can also be deleted with their matric number as the unique ID

Running app from main.py appears slightly different from running from ide. Since it was made to be installable, main.py is the intended app layout
